#*Bombina variegata* microsatellite genotyping

The aim of this project is to test and genotype 12 microsatellites in *Bombina variegata*. If necessary, additional markers will be developed and genotyped to supplement the dataset. 

1. Extract DNA from xx mouth swabs
2. Test developed *B. variegata* primers
3. Genotype all samples with optimised marker panel
4. Score msats
5. Order and develop additional primers if necessary
6. Genotype samples with additional primers



##Background info

- 12 *B. variegata* primers are already available
(papers of Hauswaldt et
al., 2007; Stuckas & Tiedemann, 2006).




- Some of these primers were problematic when applied to populations from Alsace region (2 problematic, 2 fixed)
- Similar for populations around Lac LÃ©man (1 problematic, 3 fixed)

> So I can suggest to add the last 2 ones (B14 and 12F) to our primers list
and thus test with 12 microsatellites markers; but it's possible that one or
two will not work and 1-2 could be not so informative.

- NCBI sequences for potential msat primers: 

> In addition, some microsatellite sequences of BOBO are available on
GenBank. It would be possible to develop and test them, but it would need
more time (design the primers, test the amplification, see if we can improve
the PCR condition, and see if they are variable). All these steps are the
most time consuming aspect of developing microsat.

>>> there are more developped for BOVA or/and BOBO, but I should ask
Jean-Pierre Vacher (the first that conducted the genetic analyses on
Bombina) why he selected only those ones.
