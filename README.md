# BombinaVariegata


This project was initiated in collaboration with Sam Cruickshank and Beni Schmid in 2015 at the University of ZÃ¼rich.
I am tasked with (developing?), testing, and genotyping microsatellites in *Bombina variegata* samples for Sam's PhD project. 

This repository is private, and consists of a wet lab book and note book with all information pertaining to the project.
